### Browser stream change

Very simple script to get all stream on twitch through name and switch to the other stream the moment the first stream is down.
A lot of things are not configured like multi browser access and configurable variables for selenium jar path, port and other configs which may be needed.
Searching goes through console by typping the topic name.
